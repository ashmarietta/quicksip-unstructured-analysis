## Project Overview

This project analyzes menu and pricing data from QuickSip, a coffee shop in Pittsburg, Kansas. Using web scraping, I collected unstructured menu data and performed exploratory analysis to provide strategic business suggestions.

---

## Data Source

- **Website Scraped:** https://quicksip.co/menu
- **Date Scraped:** December 1, 2025

All data was extracted using publicly available links and the requests library in Python.

---

## Installation and Requirements

To run the analysis, install the following:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ashmarietta/quicksip-unstructured-analysis.git
cd quicksip-unstructured-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Requirements include:
- pandas
- requests
- json
- matplotlib

---

## Analysis Workflow

Below is an excerpt of the code used to analyze menu data:

```{python}
import json
with open('menu.json', 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)
data = json.loads(data)

menu_items1 = data[1].get('data', {}).get('paginatedMenuItems', {}).get('items') or []
menu_items2 = data[2].get('data', {}).get('paginatedMenuItems', {}).get('items') or []

all_items = menu_items1 + menu_items2

for item in all_items:
    name = item['name']
    price = item.get('priceMoney', {}).get('amount')
    print(name, price)
```

## BREAK DOWN THE DATASET
```{python}
# shows most basic keys
data[4].get('data').keys()
```

```{python}
# shows dictionary keys
data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")[0].get('groups')[0].keys()
```

```{python}
# returns the whole menu in a dictionary format
data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")
```

```{python}
# returns group list
data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")[0].get('groups')[0].get('items')[0]
```

```{python}
# returns name of product
data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")[0].get('groups')[0].get('items')[0].get('name')
```

```{python}
# returns price
data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")[0].get('groups')[0].get('items')[0].get('prices')
```

## EVALUATE BUSINESS FOCUS
How many menu items does each major category have, and what does that say about the business focus?
```{python}
# count number of items in each group
menus = data[4].get('data').get('paginatedMenuItems').get("menus")

group_counts = {}

for menu in menus:
    groups = menu.get('groups', [])
    
    for g in groups:
        group_name = g.get("name", "UNKNOWN GROUP")
        items = g.get("items", [])
        count = len(items)
        group_counts[group_name] = group_counts.get(group_name, 0) + count

group_counts
```

```{python}
# show menu items in each group
for menu in menus:
    for g in menu.get("groups", []):
        print("\nGROUP:", g.get("name"))
        for item in g.get("items", []):
            print("   •", item.get("name"))
```

```{python}
# count of menu items by group in a dataframe
import pandas as pd
pd.DataFrame(group_counts.items(), columns=["Group", "ItemCount"])
```

Based solely on the count of menu items, it appears that QuickSip focuses primarily on coffee drinks, which also include a large portion of the holiday, fall, and summer drinks, and on food items. I find this interesting because, while Pittsburg is a small town of around 20,000 residents, it has multiple chain coffee shops, including Starbucks, Scooters, and 7 Brew, and two local coffee shops all on the north side of town. I often see many cars in the parking lots for the other chain coffee shops, but QuickSip is rarely busy. While they do advertise being fast as their business model, I wonder if moving further south near Pittsburg State University or if altering their menu to focus more on food items or smoothies would make more financial sense. I selfishly hope their menu stays the same because I love all of their holiday and fall drinks, but I also would love to see the business thrive!

## BRING IN AVERAGE PRICE BY GROUP
How do seasonal items (fall/holiday/summer drinks) compare in price to the regular menu items?
```{python}
group_avg_prices = {}

def extract_price_dollars(item):
    prices = item.get("prices", None)
    if prices is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(prices, list):
        if not prices:
            return None
        p = prices[0]
    else:
        p = prices
    if isinstance(p, dict):
        unit = p.get("unitPrice") or p.get("price") or p.get("unit_price")
        if isinstance(unit, dict) and "amount" in unit:
            cents = unit["amount"]
            if isinstance(cents, (int, float)):
                return cents
        if "amount" in p and isinstance(p["amount"], (int, float)):
            return p["amount"]
        return None
    if isinstance(p, (int, float)):
        return float(p)
    return None

for menu in menus:
    for g in menu.get("groups", []):
        group_name = g.get("name", "UNKNOWN GROUP")
        items = g.get("items", [])

        if group_name not in group_avg_prices:
            group_avg_prices[group_name] = {"total_price": 0.0, "count": 0}

        for item in items:
            price = extract_price_dollars(item)
            if price is not None:
                group_avg_prices[group_name]["total_price"] += price
                group_avg_prices[group_name]["count"] += 1

for group, stats in group_avg_prices.items():
    if stats["count"] > 0:
        stats["avg_price"] = round(stats["total_price"] / stats["count"], 2)
    else:
        stats["avg_price"] = None

group_avg_prices
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd

df_counts = pd.DataFrame(list(group_counts.items()), columns=["Group", "ItemCount"])

df_prices = pd.DataFrame(
    [{"Group": g, "AvgPrice": v["avg_price"]} for g, v in group_avg_prices.items()]
)

df_final = df_counts.merge(df_prices, on="Group", how="inner")

df_final
```

```{python}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df_plot = df_final.sort_values("AvgPrice", ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df_plot["Group"], df_plot["AvgPrice"])
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.xlabel("Menu Category")
plt.ylabel("Average Price")
plt.title("Average Menu Item Price by Category (Highest to Lowest)")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

In looking at the average prices for each menu category, it is clear that specialty drinks do have a higher price. Taking into account that the price is for the smallest size without any modifications (such as alternative milks or extra syrups), there could also be some price variability that is not accounted for in specialty beverages that may not be as prevalent for fountain drinks or food. Overall, the menu shows a clear emphasis on higher-priced specialty beverages, suggesting that QuickSip focuses on premium, customizable drink offerings rather than low-cost commodity beverages. As mentioned above, with so many other coffee companies on the same street, I wonder if QuickSip could do better by diversifying more heavily into other product categories or by moving closer to the university.

## Results and Discussion

- **Menu Size Comparison:** QuickSip offers mostly specialty coffee drinks, including holiday beverages, followed by food items.  
- **Average Pricing:** The mean price of seasonal beverages is the highest, which possibly indicates the business' perceived highest demand.

Discussion:
The data suggests QuickSip's pricing strategy is oriented towards high-end specialty beverages. The coffee shop might be missing opportunities by not focusing on menu items that competitors do not offer, such as food items like pizzas or breakfast sandwiches. It could also potentially bring in more revenue by moving locations to the other side of town where they would have a monopoly on the coffee market.

---

## Business Suggestions

Based on the analysis:

- **Expand Non-Coffee Offerings:** There may be a higher local demand for food items and smoothies.
- **Location Adjustment:** The coffee shop could consider moving to the south side of town to target the college-aged market and move further from competitors.

---

## Limitations and Future Work

- **Data Limitations:** Data is current as of early December 2025, but menu offerings can change rapidly.
- **Data Gaps:** I was not able to analyze customer reviews due to lack of data.
- **Future Work:** I would analyze the scraped data with customer surveys or sales data.
