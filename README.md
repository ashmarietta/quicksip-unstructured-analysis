# QuickSip Analysis and Business Plan
This is my final project for my unstructured data course. I scraped a coffee shop website, analyzed price data, and formed business suggestions based on the data.
Pittsburg, Kansas, is a small town of around 20,000 residents with a medium-sized college called Pittsburg State University on the south side of town. Especially for a town of this small size, it has multiple chain coffee shops, including Starbucks, Scooters, and 7 Brew, and two local coffee shops, all on the north side of town.
I often see many cars in the parking lots for the other chain coffee shops, but QuickSip, a local, family-owned coffee shop that markets its fast service and large menu as selling points, is rarely as busy.
Thus, my goal in this project is to analyze what QuickSip’s menu focus is so that I can understand their sales emphasis and how that may be impacted by other businesses nearby.
To do so, I scraped their website and consolidated the data into a Pandas dataframe. From there, I counted the number of menu items in each major category. Finally, I compared the average pricing of each category of menu items, including seasonal drinks like holiday, fall, and summer beverages, to see which of those could be a potential area of business focus.
